This is a Django project in python 3.x for my website at markzz.com. I treat
this as a side project and don't really pay much attention to it.

Some features include:
o Page management
o Personal blog with comment capabilities
o Pacman repository information (work in progress)

This is highly personalized and contains many references to markzz.com. If you
use this as a base (or as your actual site with minimal modifications) you may
want to check over and over that all references to me (except licensing of
course) is removed. This is a plan for the future to make it more generic and
suitable for others to use without modification and make it easy to install.

If you do make changes and wish to submit them (which all contributions are
absolutely welcome), please send a git formatted patch to my email at
mark.weiman@markzz.com.
